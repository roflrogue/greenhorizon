                    <header><h3>Planting</h3></header>
                    <p>At Green Horizons Lawn Service we offer monthly flowerbed maintenance to keep your plants looking vibrant. We start by laying down a 3 inch layer of mulch on less crowded flowerbeds, or alternatively a lighter layer for more crowded beds. We also prune plants and shrubs from the previous year's growing season. These services are highly recommended as they help ensure the health, viability,and continued growth of the plant. Bed edging is a finishing touch to any new or existing mulch bed. We use a mechanical bed edger to give your mulch bed a beautiful and definitive edge. </p>

                    <header><h3>Mulching</h3></header>
                    <p>If you have considered laying mulch in the past but decided not to, you may want to reconsider. Aside from aesthetics mulch offers other benefits you may not be aware of. A layer of mulch can help prevent the spread of weeds in your plant beds, reducing the need for herbicides. It also helps moderate the temperature of the soil and lock in moisture during dry weather. Additionally mulch eventually breaks down and reinvigorates the soil, adding vital nutrients your plants need to survive. This in turn invites earthworms which also improves the quality of your soil.</p>

                    <header><h3>Hedge Trimming</h3></header>
                    <p>Most shrubs and plants that are not maintained will eventually outgrow their intended space and shape and become an eyesore. If shrubs are too close to your house they could retain moisture and create havoc on your siding, brick, and or cinder block. By caring for your shrubbery you will extend their life and your landscaping will look crisp and clean enhancing your curb appeal. </p>
